Ever wanted to have your own link shortener for free? With shortlink you can turn long links like `myexampledomain.com/this-is-an-example-post` to `example.co/324nk1`. This has multiple advantages: you can write down and share the links much easier, they look prettier, and you can fit the links character-limited fields (e.g. Tweet).

Shortlink is easy to install and host on any Python 3.7 and pip capable device.
